# DOrganizer

This script was created to keep my downloads folder organized. 
I plan onto to increase the functionality of this script and also make it cross platform compatible. 
At this point i use it on my arch setup(i use arch btw) with hyprland.

## What does this do?

The script is based on very simple principle that is different file types have different file extension.
So what this does is it sorts files according to their file extension to their respective folders. 
And if a certain folder is not present it creates it. 
Also if you have a certain folder the script does not touches that folder. 

## How I use script?

Since i have hyprland installed, it lets me execute commands according to the keybindings i set. 
So i have a keybinding which directly runs the script in the background and thus keeping my downloads folder clean for me. 

Now many a times it encounters files of which the file extension is not mentioned in the script for those files, it sends them directly to others folder.

> Feel free to actually use it according to your preference and if you have any ideas regarding it do tell me about it.
